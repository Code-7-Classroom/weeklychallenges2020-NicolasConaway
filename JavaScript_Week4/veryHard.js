//make an array of any given coins
//[1, 2, 5];
//create a target that could be set to anything
//target = 11;
//make a function with an if statement
//if target is greater than 0 then lead into a for loop
//loop will calc the given values in the array to equal the target
//once calculated the code will end with a number 3 spit out signifying the amount of coins used
//if else the target is 0 and below, console.log that the value -1 beacuse the function cant add anything up to get 0
